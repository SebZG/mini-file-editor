# Mini File Editor

The Mini File Editor is a console-based application written in C that lets users:

- Create new text file.
- Append content to an existing file.
- Read and Display content from a file.

The Mini File Editor lets users append text to a file or read its contents. It uses dynamic memory for input, handles file errors gracefully, and logs actions with timestamps using a variadic function. This keeps the program modular, simple, and functional.

## Components of the Project

The whole project contains features as follows:

1. Creating New File - This operation allows us to create a new .txt file.

2. Appending to File - This operation allows us to append into an existing file.

3. Read File - This operation allows us to Read an existing file.

4. Time Stamp - Records the current date and time, it’s used to log when specific file operations like opening or writing occur.
